Use TDD to create a Dart library for converting a numeric grade to a letter grade. Create only the model layer and its associated tests, similar to how we approached the start of the leap year example. It is sufficient to deal only with simple letter grades, not “plus” nor “minus” grades. A satisfactory submission will be well-factored, following the rules of Clean Code that we have studied so far.
The work must be in a repository in our GitHub organization and have been created and managed through Android Studio. On Canvas, submit a link to your repository.
